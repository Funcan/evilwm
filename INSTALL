BUILDING EVILWM

1) Edit Makefile to suit what you want.  Instructions are included by any
   user-editable option.

2) Run 'make'

OR, run 'make allinone' - this will cat all the source files into a
single file for compilation, which gives the compiler more chance to
inline some functions (read: faster, probably smaller in this case).

3) Run 'make install'

That's it.  The README file has information on starting evilwm.
