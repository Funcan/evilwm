Desired functionality for 1.2.x:

   * EWMH compliance, including:
        + Client control via root window messages.
        + Client ordering maintained bearing in mind _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE.
     I already have some work towards this.
   * A few things can probably cease to be compile-time options.
   * Better interoperation with Xinerama (David Flynn has some patches
     for this).
   * Option for new windows to tile as well as possible.
